# Fire-Detection-from-FLAME-Dataset
Deep Learning model implementation for Fire detection both classification and segmentation from the FLAME dataset.

## Introduction
There are two applications that can be defined based on the collected FLAME dataset along with Deep Learning solutions for these problems. The first problem is the fire versus no-fire classification using a deep neural network (DNN) approach. The second problem deals with fire segmentation, which can be used for fire detection by masking the identified fire regions on video frames classified as fire-containing in the first problem.
